# Declarative Web Automation Toolkit
Developing a web scraper/automation nowadays means coding a piece of software, usually using open-source libraries for automating web browsers. This introduces a security risk, as the user of such automation has to run untrusted code; it also creates a great barrier to entry for people without programming knowledge. 
The student will familiarize themselves with methods used in the web browser automation industry.

The student will design, implement, document, and test a toolkit for user-friendly creation of declarative web automations. This toolkit will utilize its own data format for storing the automations, the student will implement an interpreter and a GUI editor for this format.

The interpreter will be then published as an installable package, the editor will be deployable as a web application.
