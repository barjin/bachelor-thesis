The body of the request must contain a JSON object with the fields \texttt{workflow} containing the workflow definition object and \texttt{parameters}, containing the optional parameters for the current workflow.

\emptyline
\verb|POST /api/performer/:id|
\smallskip

The REST \acs{API} endpoint for management of the automation running in the \textit{Editor} application backend server.

The body of the request must contain a JSON object with the field \texttt{action} describing the desired action to be executed. Currently, the only valid action is \texttt{stop},

\textbf{Other endpoints}
\smallskip

Because of legacy reasons, the \texttt{wbr-cloud} server also provides other endpoints, following the REST API practices.
These endpoints are however, not used by the \texttt{wbr-editor} frontend application and their functionality is not ensured to be stable, as they are no longer maintained.
