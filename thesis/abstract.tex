Abstract 

The goal of this thesis is to develop a declarative toolkit for developing web automations.
Despite the great number of web automation tools and libraries on the market, it is difficult 
to find one powerful enough to meet the needs of complicated web automation use cases, yet simple enough 
to be used by untrained users. 
In this thesis, we research existing web automation tools, compare them
based on their features and ease of use, and then develop our own text format for defining web automations. 
Following this, we also develop an interpreter and a validator for this format and a design and implement 
a GUI tool for creating and editing web automations in this format. 
The user testing in the last part of the thesis describes problems the users have encountered while using
the tool. In the conclusion we try to come up with solutions to those problems and suggest ideas for further 
development.
