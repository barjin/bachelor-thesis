\chapter{Implementation}

The toolkit source code is available in a public GitHub repository\footnote{\githubInfo},
along with the informal user documentation and the code and workflow file examples.
The following chapter describes the decisions made during the implementation of the toolkit.

Just like in the previous chapters, the toolkit is described in a modular fashion, following the \textit{Editor} - \textit{Runner} dichotomy.
This is also projected in the implementation, as both the \textit{Editor} and the \textit{Runner} are implemented as separate, standalone programs.
