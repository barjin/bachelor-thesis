\chapter{Design}

This chapter describes decisions made while designing parts of the project. 
It contains separate sections for all three parts of the project, i.e. \textit{the format}, \textit{the interpreter} and \textit{the editor}.

Design decisions made here should reflect the requirements mentioned in the previous chapter.
These decisions also directly influence the implementation of the project described further.
