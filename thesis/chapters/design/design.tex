\chapter{Design}

The following sections describe decisions made while designing the project. 
Starting by breaking the project into individual parts, the following chapter initially describes all the parts separately, followed by definitions of their contact points.

Design decisions made here should reflect the requirements mentioned in the \hyperref[requirements]{previous chapter}.
These decisions also directly influence the implementation of the project described further.
