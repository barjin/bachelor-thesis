\chapter{Conclusion}

The goal of this work, as stated in the \hyperref[intro]{Introduction} was to \textit{create a human-readable, declarative format for
storing and creating web automations, with an interpreter of this format and a
visual editor, allowing less technical users to create and maintain automations in
this format.}

By implementing the \textit{Editor} application and the \textit{Runner} module, this goal has been achieved in full scale.
Both parts of the project are now fully functional - in accordance with the requirements from the \autoref{requirements} Requiements - and can be used to create and edit web automations
for data extraction and process automation.
Both parts of the project have been developed in a modular fashion, which makes the further development process easier and faster.

Future work on the project includes further simplification of the \textit{Editor} application, as the current implementation does not quite fulfill the user expectations.
The simple format design could allow for automatic generation of the workflow definition files, allowing the users to create the resilient web automations by e.g. recording their actions in a browser. 
The \textit{Runner} module could also be updated with more advanced features, better support for automated data extraction or support for crawling the web.
