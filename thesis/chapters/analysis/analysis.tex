\chapter{Analysis}

To assemble a multifunctional, reusable toolkit, it is crucial to map the exact user needs.
The following chapter analyses the user requirements and project use cases. 
It also lays down different user roles and states general requirements on the software.

Despite that this work encompasses creating a comprehensible web automation definition format, an interpreter of this format and an \ac{GUI} editor, 
there is no point in carrying out user analysis for the format itself, since it only specifies grammar of the definition file. 

The following sections will therefore conduct the analysis only for the \ac{SW} part of the work, i.e. the interpreter and the editor.
