\chapter{Analysis} \label{analysis}

When assembling a multifunctional, reusable toolkit, it is crucial to map the exact user needs.
The following chapter analyses the user requirements and project use cases. 
It also describes different user roles and states general functional and nonfunctional requirements for the software.

% Despite the fact that this work encompasses creating a comprehensible web automation definition format, an interpreter of this format and an \ac{GUI} editor, 
% there is no point in carrying out user analysis for the format itself, since it only specifies the grammar of the definition file. 

% Therefore, the following sections conduct the analysis only for the \ac{SW} part of the work, i.e. the interpreter and the editor.
